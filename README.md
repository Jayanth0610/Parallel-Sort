# Parallel-Sort
Sorting is a fundamental problem in computer science, serving as the basis for many algorithms
and applications. With the growing availability of multi-core processors, parallel computing
has become an essential tool to accelerate sorting algorithms. This project implemsents a Parallel Merge Sort using thread in C++ and compares its performance against Sequential
Merge Sort and the in-built C++ std::sort.
